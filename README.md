Reflection

## The Journey so Far

Looking back at week one, I was so incredibly anxious of this class. I'm still pretty anxious. It's taken some time to be able to look back and realize all I've learned. I think the first thing I was proud of was the ability to make a directory in terminal. I walked into the class having no experience with coding, so to be able to pull up the terminal and create directories and files, I was pretty proud. Learning the basics of HTML and CSS was the most exciting because you can immediately see what your website would look like. And the ability to quickly change the font, the size or the color.

## Path to Success

I think I mistakenly thought that I would finish this course and be ready for a coding job. But, I am understanding that my education won't ever really stop. For each project, as I go back over the beginning and have to better learn the basics, it's becoming slightly easier. The syntax doesn't seem so foreign. It's still hard, but I am able to remember more. I'm hoping I can go back over the beginning assignments and use more CSS and Javascript to make my assignments more visually pleasing. My original assignments were bare-minimums because I wasn't understanding much. But I'm starting to create categories in my brain of where to put the information I'm learning. It's getting easier, but very slowly.
I'm hoping to spend more time watching supplemental videos to help better understand how to do all of this. I clearly need things to be explained more than once and in many different ways. I've found a few online courses to help as well as some youtube instructors. I now understnad that by the end of the course, I will NOT be ready for a job but I will have something of a foundation to build on. I want to be able to find a job that continues to teach and mentor me to become a better programmer.
